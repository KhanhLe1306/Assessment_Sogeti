Please import this above link to get a route collection in Postman where I put test cases for 7 routes. 

1. Add Products       : => Add products so we can add them to orders (cart)
2. Get product list   : => return products are available to add 
3. Get all orders     : => return all current orders
4. Add an order       : => return order id
5. Get an order by id : => return order with products
6. Update order       : => update order
7. Cancel order       : => Remove (delete) order
